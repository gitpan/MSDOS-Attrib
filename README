MSDOS-Attrib version 1.06, released September 6, 2014


MSDOS::Attrib allows you to get or set file attributes under
OS/2 or Windows 95/NT.  These are the standard file attributes
(read-only, hidden, system, archive, and directory).  If you
want to access OS/2 extended attributes, use the OS2::ExtAttr
module.  If you want to access Windows NT security attributes,
try the Win32::FileSecurity module.

MSDOS::Attrib was previously known as OS2::Attrib.  I renamed
it because it now works on Win32 systems as well as OS/2.  To
upgrade, simply replace "OS2::Attrib" with "MSDOS::Attrib" in
any programs that use it.
